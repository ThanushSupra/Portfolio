          I'm currently diving more into Machine Learning and AI related stuff within the industry as that is where my passion lies.
          Whilst doing that, I am also refurbishing Full-Stack and Python skills, with plans on building a discord bot for personal use
          relatively soon. Outside of tech, I tend to spend most of my times hitting the gym, playing soccer, or just listening to new music!
